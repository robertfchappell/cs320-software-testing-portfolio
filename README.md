Reflection

 I write clear specifications and test each rule with unit tests to make sure my code and applications work and are safe.  JUnit lets me check every input condition and make sure that the code always works the same way.  Validating inputs, properly handling faulty data, and ensuring sure nothing unexpected gets through are the major ways to keep things safe and stable.

 I break down user needs into basic rules that the program must follow when I figure them out.  For instance, if the user indicates that an ID must be unique or that a name can't be too long, I make those checks directly in the class and in the matching JUnit tests.  I attempt to think about each requirement from the point of view of how someone would really use the application so that the features meet real needs.

 When I make software, I normally start by making the fundamental classes and figuring out what each piece of data should do.  Then I construct the service layer that will handle those things.  I try to keep things simple, check things early, and develop tests as I go.  This makes the structure easy to grasp and helps keep issues to a minimum later on.  This way of doing things makes it easier to add to or change the software later without messing up everything else.
